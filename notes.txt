so this is a package for crafting tcp and udp and probably more to come test socket servers in
python without going through the hussle of writing socket code yourself every single time.

so the vision is to achieve something like golang.

def tcp_client():
	try:
		tcp_cl = net.Dial(":80", "tcp")
		tcp_cl.write(b"some arbitrary data")
	except Exception:
		raise

def handle_conn(c: net.TCPConn):
	print(f'serving {c.remote_addr()}')
	c.write(b"you've been served!")

def tcp_listen():
	try:
		l = net.Listen(":80", "tcp")
		while True:
			tcp_conn = l.accept()
			handle_conn(tcp_conn)
	except Exception:
		raise
